# Horse-Racing-Project

Horses run along a track of a given length.
If they fall, they stop there for ever.
If they reach the end, they win.
When a horse wins, their confidence increases.
If they fall, their confidence drops.
A higher confidence means they run quicker, however this also means they're more likely to fall.

## Part 1

Again: race the same horses on the same track again

New race: generate more random horses and race with them instead

Quit: Stop the program

## Part 2

Start race: takes you to a page where you can either bet on a horse (with the amount entered), or play the race without betting. At the end, the results will display who fell, won and how long the race took. If you bet, you will also see the results of your bet. You can only bet an amount you have in our balance.

Edit Track: Edit the length of the track (distance horses have to all travel). You can also create new horses with a name and confidence that you set (or generate a random one). For each horse created, you can change their symbol, colour and accessory.

View Statistics: Here you can view the full history of horses and races from the past simulations. You can also erase the history.
